	  <p id="bio"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/headshot-700x700.jpg" alt="a picture of miles rose" class="curve" id="headshot">I'm a Multimedia Designer and Web Developer. 
	  I have a background in Graphic Design, Programming, Animation, Illustration and Sculpture. I have done freelance Motion Graphic and video work for over seven years, working with <a href="http://bigscreenentgroup.com/" class="redlink" target="blank"> companies</a>, <a href="http://greenlivingscience.org/" class="redlink" target="blank"> non-profits</a>, and individuals to provide animated video solutions to assist in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLve5ZqklD9TecJKQxuKJ2bGzfzs_-o0gF" class="redlink" target="blank"> education</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4012981/" class="redlink" target="blank"> feature films</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8wHHXzBYgU" class="redlink" target="blank"> music videos</a> and more.
	  I grew up home schooled, and I would probably describe myself as a self taught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism" class="redlink" target="blank">autodidact</a>. I strongly believe that it's important to always be a life-long learner, and that keeping up with current technologies is a great way to stay mentally agile and competitive.

	  I have been interested in entrepreneurship from a young age, when I was 17 years old I saved money from a part time job to <a href="http://cargocollective.com/behindthefaces/Miles-Rose" class="redlink" target="blank"> buy and renovate a cheap house in Detroit</a>, living there for 3 years. When I was 20, I sold the house for almost twice what I had bought it for, using the money to finance my living expenses while I attend college full time.

	  Right now I am working on my degree in Web Development at Henry Ford College. Web Development, Programming, and UI Design have been interests of mine for a long time, and I am trying to learn as much as I can on the subject so that I can switch careers into the tech industry. I <a href="http://milesrose.net/blog/" class="redlink" target="blank"> blog</a> about what I learn as a way for me to organize my thoughts and document my learning journey. I also post <a href="http://milesrose.net/blog/design/" class="redlink" target="blank"> design tutorials</a> on my blog to break down some of my animation methods for other people to learn from.
	  Feel free to check out the projects on my <a href="http://milesrose.net" class="redlink" target="blank"> portfolio</a> and post a comment. If you'd like to contact me directly, you can reach me at <b>miles@milesrose.net</b> or via any of the social media links bellow.</p>
