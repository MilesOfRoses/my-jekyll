The word “Spirituality” has always been tricky for me since it seems to have a different meaning to each person. That word tends to most often be used by people who I do not share much in common with philosophically. Since I don’t have any beliefs that could be considered “supernatural”I have usually leaned away from the term “Spiritual” as well. However, despite this, I have had people tell me that they consider my lifestyle and philosophy to be “very spiritual” so maybe others are more easily able to see the spirituality in me which I am not able to see myself. But still, “spiritual” it is not a label that I am comfortable applying to myself. That being said, I do still feel that it is possible to derive spiritual value from naturalistic sources, especially the fields of Ecology and Cosmology.
<br><br>

For example, “Biophilia” or the “love of nature” seems to be present in most mentally sound people and animals. This love of nature only makes sense, we evolved in nature and not in artificial environments. So we prefer some expression of that nature, even if it is fake and decorative.
<br><br>
My own biophilia has led me down the path of permaculture, to work with nature closely every day.
<br><br>
Does nature have a conscious intelligence? Probably not in the sense that we think of human conscious intelligence, but what other examples do we have to compare to?
<br><br>
Plants and fungus have their own intelligence. Trees remember, learn and count. Slime mold solves mazes. Fungal mycelium connects tree roots in a forest, transmitting chemical/electrical information to them about what else is happening in the forest. If one tree is being attacked by insects, the wood wide web lets the rest of the forest know so that they can defend themselves with naturally produced pesticides.
<br><br>
If an entire forest can have intelligent behavior, could the entire planet?
There doesn’t seem to be a single mycelium network that spans the globe to be able to transmit information. But there might be other ways to transmit information on wind or in the ocean, if not underground.
<br><br>
What kind of properties would an intelligent entity have that spans the biosphere and is 4 billion years old? We can barely understand the intelligence of a plant or mushroom. We can barely understand our own intelligence. 
<br><br>
If there is a planetary intelligence (and I am still not sure that there necessarily is) would it have the ability to transmit information to individuals, in the same way that a fungal mycelium network can transmit information to individual trees? Is that my “muse” directing me down a path of biophilia and permaculture in an attempt to heal some of the wounds that humanity has inflicted on the earth? Or is that too much of a grandiose vision for my own purpose? “I have been called by an ancient goddess to do her bidding” doesn’t really sound like something I would proclaim with a straight face.
