title: My Resource Consumption Compared to the Average American
meta: Living off the grid, I use 6% of the water and 8% of the electricity compared to the average American

I did the math and it turns out my lifestyle uses just 6% of the water that the average American uses per person.  And my electrical usage is about 8% of the average American per person. Imagine if everyone in America (and all industrialized nations) used such few resources, there might be a chance of beating climate change.
<br><br>
Each American uses an average of 82 gallons of water a day at home. between my garden, my Partner, and myself, we uses at most 60 gallons a day, 50 for irrigation and 10 for the trailer. Many days, irrigation needs are even less. That amounts to 5 gallons of water for personal use each, which is 6% of what the average American uses.
<br><br>
American Residential daily consumption of electricity is 12,000 watt hours per person.
My battery bank has a maximum capacity of 2,400 watt hours, but I would not consume that all in one day, maybe 2 or 3 days, which would be between 800 and 1,200  watt hours per day, which could be rounded to 1,000 watt hours per day for easier math. So the trailer's electrical consumption is about 8% of the average American consumption.

This is not to blame the average American *individual* at all, this system was designed before we were born by the ultra wealthy and top capital owning classes, primarily to their benefit. The average American didn't sign up for this system, we were all simply born into this late stage capitalistic hellscape.
